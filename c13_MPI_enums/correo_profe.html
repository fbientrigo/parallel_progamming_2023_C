Hello professor graeme, I was asking about a problem that I have with the schedule of the class,
that's the monday class is at the same time that of the course of profesor villanueva.

I'm havingr touble keeping up with the class,
and would like to start a github project with other classmates
so we can do a group project and maybe provide grade some extra points
So we can end up the course in SFML or SDL2 libraries for real time visualization.
